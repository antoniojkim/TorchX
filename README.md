# TorchX

An "eXtension" to the PyTorch Deep Learning Framework. It contains "eXtra" features and functionality that I wish were in the official PyTorch framework.

## Install

TorchX is set up as a pip installable Python package:

```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/antoniojkim/TorchX.git
```
